I need to research recent advances in transformer neural networks for natural language processing. Specifically, I want to understand the latest improvements in attention mechanisms, self-attention, and how these architectures are being applied to language understanding tasks. I'm looking for technical details about model architectures, training methodologies, and performance benchmarks.
